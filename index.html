          Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
          education system, which falls under the command of the government at
          three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the
          Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
          the total number of public schools to private schools in India is
          10:3.

          Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as
          improving access and quality, reducing disparities and dropouts,
          increasing enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning outcomes
          and employability, strengthening governance and accountability,
          promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of
          COVID-19 pandemic. It is influenced by various policies and programmes
          at the national and state levels, such as the National Education
          Policy 2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik
          Shiksha Abhiyan, the Midday Meal Scheme, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao
          Scheme, and the National Digital Education Architecture. It is also
          supported by various stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF,
          UNESCO, World Bank, civil society organizations, academic
          institutions, private sector entities, and media outlets.

          In January 2019, India had over 900 universities and 40,000
          colleges.In India's higher education system, a significant number of
          seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the
          historically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and
          Other Backward Classes. In universities, colleges, and similar
          institutions affiliated to the central government, there is a maximum
          50% of reservations applicable to these disadvantaged groups, at the
          state level it can vary. Maharashtra had 73% reservation in 2014,
          which is the highest percentage of reservations in India
